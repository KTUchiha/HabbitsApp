All data you create within the App, including:

- All user data is stored exclusively on your iOS device using Core Data
- No cloud synchronization or backup services are used

## Data Security

Your data is protected by:

## Children's Privacy

HabitMaster does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The App is suitable for all ages and does not require any personal information to function.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
